# WebFlix


Welcome to WebFlix, a website prototype of a streaming platform developed for a college graded unit project using PHP, MySQL, Bootstrap, and jQuery as per guidance and school recommendation. This platform streams trailers and mock placeholder videos.

## Features

- Back-end or admin panel with the ability to add and edit user and content data
- Welcome page with feature trailers, navigation, and live-search
- Content pages with the ability to play video or trailer based on the user's plan
- Basic reviews (no review management)
- Basic user accounts with editable details and subscriptions
- 3 tiers of plans with yearly or monthly payments
- PayPal Sandbox integration
- Ability to view, change, or cancel plans
- Custom, simple branding and design.

## Missing Features

Due to time constraints and building on a messy base where the developer learned as they went, there are some missing features:

- [ ] Responsiveness: Mobile-first was not the approach, and by the time of the deadline, it was too late for refactor. There is lots of room for future commits on the bright side.
- [ ] Small bugs to fix.

## Live Demo

A live demo of the project is available at [Webflix Demo Page] (https://webflix-demo.site)
